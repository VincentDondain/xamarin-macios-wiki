This is where we track the **bindings effort work**.

After a new version of Xcode comes out, we usually run a **diff-tool** to know what changed. The results then becomes *wiki pages* and these are the documents we use to add or update our bindings.

As changes can be pretty massive, we need to **split the work** between Xamarin.iOS team members, and now, our lovely contributors.

You will find in this page a list of what we will call "sections", composed of a set of pages for every framework that has changed for a given new OS version. For instance: *"iOS 10 beta1 to iOS 10 beta2 diffs"*. Each section also as a **ToDo list**. That list has to be updated with **your name** for the framework you wish to bind. Once a framework is claimed, the owner can update the framework diff page by simply **removing** what has been bound. *Note: you can add comments (radar, PR) in the list as well.*
